## Abnormally Injecting Style into HTML

> *"The promise of love, the pain of loss, the joy of redemption, then give him a puzzle and watch him dance."*

This was an idea, much like a gift for my girlfriend (who dumped me in the end anyway). I've no idea what good this is gonna do, but it's kinda beautiful to watch, so I decided to maintain a repo for that.

It basically pushes the contents of a stylesheet into a `<style>` element and a `<pre>` element at the same time (slowly), so that we can see how a browser engine repaints the window as the style element is modified.
